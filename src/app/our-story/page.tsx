                Dear diary,

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Freeman and I are two people who lived in two different worlds,
                had little to no mutual friends, and yet somehow still met in a
                very divine and unexpected way. This could only be God.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                On 17 April 2023, I prayed for my future husband and felt moved
                to make a list describing the kind of man I wanted to marry. At
                first, I refused because I did not want to limit myself to a
                list. The thought persisted until I finally gave in the next
                day. On 18 April, I wrote in you, dear diary, about the kind of
                person I hoped my husband would be, and I eventually found that
                man.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Later that year, I moved to Accra to stay with my aunty and her
                husband for my sixth year clinicals. I was born and raised in
                Sunyani, so I needed an Assemblies of God church now that I was
                in Accra. My cousin showed me More Than Conquerors A/G because
                it was the route he remembered best. I still remember him joking
                that my husband might be in that church, and I told him we don't
                go to church to find husbands but to get closer to God (I should
                have listened to my prophetic brother).
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The first Sunday I went to MTC was Senior Pastor's Appreciation
                Day, and that was the first day I saw Freeman. So basically, I
                met him in church. He was (and still is) my Sunday School
                teacher. We became friends through Sunday School, although we
                did not talk much. I really admired the way he taught the Bible
                and that admiration slowly became a crush, which I kept praying
                against because, in my mind, we don't come to church to find
                husbands. Apparently, he was also crushing on me, but I had no
                idea.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In January 2024, I fasted and prayed into the new year,
                particularly about my relationship status. I made a pact with
                God that I would not idolize marriage and that I would stay
                single even until I am 50 unless I find someone who is truly for
                me. My biggest fear, like most people (which is very valid), is
                settling for "I will manage them like that." I don't know about
                others, but as for me, I cannot manage. And I thank God for
                that.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Long story short, I didn't have to wait till 50—if I did, you
                wouldn't be reading this in 2025! Freeman and I started talking
                more than we used to. We spent hours on the phone, we were so
                gone, and it was very obvious we liked each other.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                I still needed the two-factor authentication because attraction
                and feelings aren't enough for choosing a life partner. You know
                there's this quote on social media that God rapidly listens to
                the "If this person is not good for me, please end it" prayer?
                Aha! So, I started praying that prayer because I cannot go
                through any affliction. I then realized that prayer topic wasn't
                working, so I asked God to show me in a dream why I should end
                it, but instead I dreamt about why I shouldn't end it.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Physically, I heard from Freeman's lips why I shouldn't end it.
                I saw in his actions why I shouldn't end it. And I felt an
                overwhelming peace I had never felt before. That was it for me.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In March 2024, he asked me out. Of course I said yes because I
                knew this connection was divine and peaceful, and I had prayed
                about it and knew I could go ahead. And most importantly, I
                really, really liked him—and I still like him and love him. I
                know this is the best decision I have ever made by God's grace,
                and I know God will give us more grace for the forever journey
                ahead.
