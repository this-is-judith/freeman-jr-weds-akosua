                Dear diary,
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Freeman and I are two people who lived in two different worlds,
                had little to no mutual friends, and yet somehow still met in a
                very divine and unexpected way. This could only be God.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                On 17th April 2023, I prayed for my future husband and felt
                moved to make a list describing the kind of man I wanted to
                marry. At first, I refused because I did not want to limit
                myself to a list. The thought persisted until I finally gave in
                the next day. On 18th April, I wrote in you, dear diary, about
                the kind of person I hoped my husband would be, and I eventually
                found that man.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Later that year, I moved to Accra to stay with my aunty and her
                husband for my sixth year clinicals. I was born and raised in
                Sunyani, so I was looking for an Assemblies of God church now
                that I was in Accra. My cousin showed me More Than Conquerors
                A/G because it was the route he remembered best. I still
                remember him joking that my husband might be in that church, and
                I told him we don't go to church to find husbands but to get
                closer to God (I should have listened to my prophetic brother).
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The first Sunday I went to MTC was Senior Pastor's Appreciation
                Day, and that was the first day I saw Freeman. So basically, I
                met him in church. He was (and still is) my Sunday School
                teacher. We became friends through Sunday School, although we
                did not talk much. I really admired the way he taught the Bible
                and that admiration slowly became a crush, which I kept praying
                against because, in my mind, we don't come to church to find
                husbands. Apparently, he was also crushing on me, but I had no
                idea.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In January 2024, I began the new year with fasting and prayer,
                bringing my relationship status before God. I promised Him that
                I would not idolize marriage and that I would remain single,
                even until fifty, unless I met the person He had truly chosen
                for me. My biggest fear, one I know many people understand, was
                settling for a relationship built on “I will manage them like
                that.” I know in my heart that I cannot live that way, and I
                thank God for making that clear to me.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Long story short, I did not have to wait until fifty. If I had,
                you would not be reading this in 2025. Freeman and I started
                talking more than we ever had before. We spent hours on the
                phone, we were so gone, and it was very clear that we liked each
                other.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                I still needed my own kind of two-factor authentication because
                attraction and feelings are not enough when choosing a life
                partner. You know that quote on social media that says God
                responds quickly to the prayer, “If this person is not good for
                me, please end it”? That was the prayer I started praying
                because I cannot willingly enter any affliction. When nothing
                seemed to change, I asked God to show me in a dream why I should
                end things, but instead I dreamt about why I should not.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Physically, I heard from Freeman’s own lips why I should not end
                it. I saw, through his actions, the reasons I should stay. And I
                felt a deep, overwhelming peace that I had never experienced
                before. That was enough for me.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In March 2024, he asked me out. I said yes because I knew our
                connection was both divine and peaceful. I had prayed about it,
                and I knew in my heart that I could move forward. Most
                importantly, I really, really liked him, and I still like him
                and love him. I am confident this is the best decision I have
                ever made by God’s grace, and I trust He will give us even more
                grace for the forever journey ahead.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                We met each other’s families, and the rest is history. We have
                chosen each other for a lifetime. We are getting married soon
                and my heart is fuller than it's ever been.

              <p className="leading-relaxed italic text-burgundy">
                Dear diary,
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Every couple has a unique love story, and ours is nothing short
                of a masterful display of predestination.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                On Pastor’s Appreciation Day 2023, unbeknownst to me, the woman
                I would soon call my wife had divinely made her way into the
                church for the very first time. The programme was good, but I
                did not notice the new eyes that saw me until the day after. As
                a Christian with the understanding that marriage is a covenant
                never to be exited once entered, I had promised God and myself
                that I would rather remain single than be with someone who
                lacked the qualities I was looking for. Not a perfect being, but
                a box-ticker.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                After I met my fiancée (wife after the 27th! 😁), the long list
                of traits I had quietly hidden in my heart suddenly felt short.
                She ticked the boxes, created new ones, and ticked those too. I
                had revised this list countless times and now realize that God
                was simply describing Ndwaa to me all along. I knew I would
                recognize the woman of my dreams when I met her, and I did.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In a heartbeat, I fell for her. But of course, I had decided I
                could not date. Then again, God’s plans are not ours 🙈. I took
                particular notice of her on New Year’s Eve 2024. I still
                remember the white and black dress, with the WGHS sash draped
                across her neck. Shush 🤫 it wasn’t really about the sash, but
                about the plethora of qualities she possesses. Still, the sash
                read: “Live right, speak true, right wrong, follow the King.” I
                saw all of these in her.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                These qualities became even more evident the more we talked. In
                the Sunday School class I taught, she overcame her natural
                introversion to share her thoughts — seasoned with wisdom and
                understanding — which revealed her depth of Scripture. She was
                bold. She was different. Different enough to make me break my
                personal rule of “no dating in the same church.” And on
                21/03/24, I asked her out. Her “yes” came from a place of mutual
                feeling — and it was the best feeling ever!
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Here comes the twist: I’ll stop my POV here, because if I
                continue, John 21:25 would happen to this piece. If you need a
                reference to know what that means, perhaps you should attend
                Sunday School a bit more 😉. All thanks and glory to the Ancient
                God. Only He could make it possible for Osei-Tete and Nyamekye
                to display His glory.
